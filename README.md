# Templex Engine

***I Tried To Create This mini Template engine Framework in order to simulate Warp framework in joomla  v4.X , the most used classes are the helpers there is about Ten so of them i had a project and i recreated only about 5 that i needed, helpers instances or global object instances as you know: are the following***
- [ ] $this['config']
- [ ] $this['path']
- [ ] $this['template']
- [ ] $this['widgets']
- [x] $this['assets']
- [ ] $this['system']

> but i did'nt make a global instance  assets   => $this['assets'], so you have to load your assets files and assets , feel fee fork my project and scaling up this feature!
